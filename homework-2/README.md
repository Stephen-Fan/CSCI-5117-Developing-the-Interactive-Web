<!-- Case 1: If you want to test for multiple users functionality, follow the following instructions.
After you logout your first account, you will be sent back to the index page. Please refresh your webpage (i.e. F5), then login to your second account. The same approach applies to more accounts. -->

Case 1: If you want to assign a category to a todo item in /todo/:id page, follow the following instructions.<br>
Before you assign a category to a todo item, make sure you have at least two categories. <br>
* (1) If you only have 1 category, please create a new category first and then feel free to assign the category to the todo item.<br>
* (2) If you have more than 1 category, feel free to assign category to any todo item directly.<br>
    * (2.1) When you delete a category (remaining categories are still more than 1), the todo items belong to this category will reset their category back to null. If you want to assign a new category to it, please select any other categories first and then select the category you want to assign, then click save.

Case 2: TODO Item page, i.e. /todo/:id<br>
* If you want to check an unfinished todo item, this page allows you to change and save todo item's text and category. Also, you are able to mark it as done. However, if you want to check a completed todo item, this page will only show you the text and category but not allow you to modify them.
